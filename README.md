    CPSC 473: Front-End Web Engineering - Summer 2018
    Homework 7.
    In this assignment, you will create the front-end for the Chattrbox application


    -  When npm watch is running, Chattrbox can be viewed at
      http://localhost:3000

    -  Chattrbox pages use the HTML and CSS from
      front-end-resources.zip

    -  package.json and .babelrc have been created.

    -  Multiple clients can connect to http://localhost:3000
      and participate in a chat

    -  Chat messages show up in all connected clients in real-time

    -  An .eslintrc.js file is present in the root of the repository and has been
      modified to allow ES6 syntax

    -  All issues detected by linter-eslint have been fixed

    -  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code reformatted with the atom-beautify plugin

    -  Project directory pushed to new GitHub repository listed above

    -  Project directory has been pushed using a GitHub client, not by manually
       dragging-and-dropping files onto the GitHub web page
